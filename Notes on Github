In your winter term repository, create a "Notes on Github" markdown file that is a summary/how to of the important
things we have covered in github so far. You can reference these notes in the future should you need to remind yourself
of how to do something. These notes might include information on key terms, permissions for teams and organizations,
or syncing from your computer and the app to github.
